\section*{Morphological Processing}

\textbf{Morphological image processing} (or morphology) describes a range of image processing techniques that deal with the shape (or morphology) of features in an image.

Morphological operations are typically applied to remove imperfections introduced during segmentation, and so typically operate on bi-level images

\subsection*{Structuring Elements, Hits and Fits}

Small binary image which defines the shape of the operation, similar to a convolution kernel.

Structuring elements can be of any shape and size, typically we use rectangular images with origin at the \textbf{middle pixel}.
